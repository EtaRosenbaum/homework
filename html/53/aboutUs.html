                <p> Thyme Café is the sister brand of the well-known Rosemary Bagels in Lakewood, NJ, a name recognized
                    for quality and
                    flavor. Inspired by their family’s passion for food and community, Thyme was founded by two sisters
                    with a vision of
                    creating a warm, inviting space where people could enjoy fresh, flavorful meals made with care. What
                    began as a
                    local
                    café has since grown into a thriving brand, with multiple locations across the United States, each
                    one upholding the
                    same commitment to quality and hospitality.

                    At Thyme Café, we offer a wide range of fresh, handcrafted lunch options—from nourishing bowls and
                    gourmet
                    sandwiches to
                    hearty breakfast plates served all day. We're also known for our selection of house-baked desserts,
                    including rich
                    pastries, cookies, and other sweet treats made daily. Whether you're stopping in for a quick coffee,
                    a cozy brunch,
                    or a
                    relaxing lunch with friends, Thyme Café brings together the comfort of home-style cooking with the
                    experience of
                    modern café culture. </p>
