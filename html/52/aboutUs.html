<p> Thyme Café is the sister brand of the well-known Rosemary Bagels in Lakewood, NJ, a name recognized for quality and
    flavor. Inspired by their family’s passion for food and community, Thyme was founded by two sisters with a vision of
    creating a warm, inviting space where people could enjoy fresh, flavorful meals made with care. What began as a
    local
    café has since grown into a thriving brand, with multiple locations across the United States, each one upholding the
    same commitment to quality and hospitality.

    At Thyme Café, we offer a wide range of fresh, handcrafted lunch options—from nourishing bowls and gourmet
    sandwiches to
    hearty breakfast plates served all day. We're also known for our selection of house-baked desserts, including rich
    pastries, cookies, and other sweet treats made daily. Whether you're stopping in for a quick coffee, a cozy brunch,
    or a
    relaxing lunch with friends, Thyme Café brings together the comfort of home-style cooking with the experience of
    modern café culture. </p>
